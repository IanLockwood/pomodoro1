# A beautiful, functional, customizable Pomodoro Timer built in React.

Features:
* Completely customizable
* Switches colors to let you know which phase (work, break, long break) you're in.
* Startable, Pauseable, Stoppable
* Renders different components based on the the current phase. For example, before starting the timer, the user has access to customization controls and the start button. But while running, the user has access to a pause button and a stop button.
* Responsive - works as a one page mobile app with no scrolling.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
